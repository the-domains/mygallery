ok everything apart from the 2nd is a carousel..

if you click on the albums and go through to their own page.. then all the images are layed out in a square aspect. What is interesting to notice is how Molly the AI has cropped the images.. She is always focuses on the correct part of the image, whether it's a face, or the 'main object' in the image..

Let's unpublish the 2nd gallery.. and see if the rest remain as carousels..

Simple ansa it worked.. unpublishing the one gallery that wasn't a carousel left a page of 5 galleries all in carousel fashion.. it seems after the initial carousel, its then layout, and then every other subsequent gallery is carousel again..

I re published the non-carousel gallery for people to see..

Changed the last gallery to just on it's own page. With the carousel posts, by default Molly sets them to Homepage and Ownpage.. on ownpage it looks like she just lays them out in squares.. perfectly cropped using AI to focus on the main subject.. but loses the carousel..

Also loses the full screen aspect.. to have multiple separate galleries on their own page, it would be necessary to use multiple grid sites.. which sometimes isn't a bad thing if it is your main site.

Custom domain.. then use subdomains...

eg www.gallery.com as the main grid site

landscapes.gallery.com as a second grid site

faces.gallery.com as a 3rd grid site

link them all via either nav or CTAs...
