ok everything apart from the 2nd is a carousel..

if you click on the albums and go through to their own page.. then all the images are layed out in a square aspect. What is interesting to notice is how Molly the AI has cropped the images.. She is always focuses on the correct part of the image, whether it's a face, or the 'main object' in the image..

Let's unpublish the 2nd gallery.. and see if the rest remain as carousels..

Simple ansa it worked.. unpublishing the one gallery that wasn't a carousel left a page of 5 galleries all in carousel fashion.. it seems after the initial carousel, its then layout, and then every other subsequent gallery is carousel again..

I re published the non-carousel gallery for people to see..
